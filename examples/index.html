	<p>For the constrained control problem, local state $x_i(k)$ and control \\(u_i(k)\\) vectors are subject to 
		polytopic constraints
 $$
 \left\{
 \begin{aligned}
 x_i(k) \in \X_i, & \ \X_i = \{ x_i \in \mathbb{R}^{n_i} \mid F_{x_i} x_i \le g_{x_i} \},\\
 u_i(k) \in \U_i, & \ \U_i = \{ u_i \in \mathbb{R}^{m_i} \mid F_{u_i} u_i \le g_{u_i}\},
 \end{aligned}
 \right.
$$
\\(\forall\, k\ge 0\\), \\(i\in \mathcal{N}\\), where \\(F_{x_i}\\), \\(F_{u_i}\\) are constant matrices and \\(g_{x_i}\\), 
\\(g_{u_i}\\) are constant vectors of appropriate dimension with positive elements, and the origin is contained in the 
interior of the sets. The inequalities are component-wise.
