title: ICT, Interpolating Control Toolbox

<div class="blurb">
	<h1>Interpolating Control Toolbox (ICT)</h1>
	<p>The Interpolating control toolbox (ICT) is a free and open-source MATLAB toolbox for the constrained control 
	of discrete-time linear systems. Precisely, it employs (centralised or decentralised) interpolation-based control (IC) 
	for time-invariant and uncertain time-varying discrete-time linear systems with (global or local) state and control 
	constraints. The toolbox combines geometrical features to compute robust invariant sets offline and solves a 
	linear programming problem to compute the required IC online.
