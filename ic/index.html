	<h2>Set Invariance and Constrained Control</h2>
	
	<p>Set invariance is a fundamental concept for the construction of controllers for constrained dynamical systems 
	subject to state and control constraints, and bounded disturbances. Constraint satisfaction can be guaranteed 
	for all time instances (and for bounded disturbances) if and only if the initial state is contained inside a 
	(robust) controlled invariant set. </p>
		
	<p>Set invariance methods can be used to derive optimal controllers for linear systems with atypical 
	(specifically, non-quadratic) cost criteria. Moreover, robust controlled invariant sets operating 
	in regions that can be enforced through feedback control to perpetually satisfy constraints in the 
	presence disturbances,  can be used for robust control of linear uncertain systems. Related applications 
	include safety set verification, explicit MPC, Interpolation-based Control (IC), and viability theory.</p>
	
	<p>Set invariance is strictly connected with Lyapunov stability.</p>
	
<!--
		<p>For the constrained control problem, local state $x_i(k)$ and control $u_i(k)$ vectors are subject to 
		polytopic constraints
			$$
 \left\{
 \begin{aligned}
 x_i(k) \in \mathcal{X}_i, & \ \mathcal{X}_i = \{ x_i \in \mathbb{R}^{n_i} \mid F_{x_i} x_i \le g_{x_i} \},\\
 u_i(k) \in \mathcal{U}_i, & \ \mathcal{U}_i = \{ u_i \in \mathbb{R}^{m_i} \mid F_{u_i} u_i \le g_{u_i}\},
 \end{aligned}
 \right.
$$
$\forall\, k\ge 0$, $i\in \mathcal{N}$, where $F_{x_i}$, $F_{u_i}$ are constant matrices and $g_{x_i}$, 
$g_{u_i}$ are constant vectors of appropriate dimension with positive elements, and the origin is contained in the 
interior of the sets. The inequalities are component-wise.
